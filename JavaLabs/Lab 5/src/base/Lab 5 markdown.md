## Lab Thought Process:

To make the code dry I simply made a customer function which would take in 3 variables: pretzels bought, lemonade bought, and the tip given.

After that used those variables to do the calculations that were done individually for each customer in the wet code.

I then called the customer function 15 times for each customer and filled them in the the associated values to get the same answer with a much more dry solution.
